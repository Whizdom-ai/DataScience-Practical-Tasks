# Data Science Technical Interview Tasks

Welcome to the Data Science technical interview tasks repository. This repository contains a set of tasks designed to assess your data science and machine learning skills. Please follow the instructions below to complete the tasks using GitHub Codespaces.

## Getting Started

To get started, please follow these steps:

### 1. Set Up Your GitHub Account

If you don't already have a GitHub account, please create one [here](https://github.com/join).

### 2. Fork the Repository (Optional)

If you would like to work on a separate copy of this repository, you can fork it by clicking the "Fork" button at the top right of the repository page.

### 3. Open the Repository in a Codespace

1. **Navigate to the Repository**: Go to the GitHub repository containing the tasks.

2. **Create a Codespace**:
   - Click on the green "Code" button.
   - Select "Open with Codespaces" and then "New codespace".
   - This will launch a new Codespace environment where you can work on the tasks.

3. **Wait for the Environment to Initialize**: The Codespace will take a few moments to set up. Once it's ready, you'll see a fully functional development environment in your browser.

### 4. Access the Notebooks

1. **Navigate to the Notebooks Folder**: In the Codespace, you will see a file explorer on the left-hand side. Navigate to the `notebooks` folder.

2. **Open a Notebook**: Click on the notebook you want to work on (e.g., `data_cleaning_preprocessing.ipynb`) to open it in the interactive environment.

### 5. Work on the Tasks

1. **Follow the Instructions**: Each notebook contains specific tasks related to data cleaning, EDA, model development, and recommender systems. Follow the instructions provided in each notebook to complete the tasks.

2. **Run the Code**: You can execute code cells by clicking on them and pressing `Shift + Enter`. The output will be displayed directly below each code cell.

### 6. Save Your Work

1. **Save Changes**: As you work through the tasks, your changes will be automatically saved in the Codespace.

2. **Commit Your Changes (Optional)**: If you forked the repository, you can commit your changes by using the Git controls in the Codespace.

### 7. Submit Your Work

1. **Download the Completed Notebooks**: Once you have completed the tasks, you can download the notebooks by right-clicking on the file in the file explorer and selecting "Download".

2. **Submit via Email**: Send the completed notebooks as attachments to the provided email address or submit them according to the instructions provided during the interview process.

## Task Overview

Below is a brief overview of the tasks included in this repository:

1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**: Clean and preprocess a dataset with missing values and categorical variables.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Perform EDA on a customer purchase dataset and visualize key insights.
3. **Model Development and Evaluation**: Build and evaluate a classification model to predict customer churn.
4. **Recommender System Implementation**: Implement a basic collaborative filtering recommendation system.

## Troubleshooting

If you encounter any issues while working in GitHub Codespaces, please consider the following:

- **Reinitialize Codespace**: If the Codespace becomes unresponsive, try stopping and reinitializing it.
- **Internet Connection**: Ensure that you have a stable internet connection to avoid disruptions.
- **Contact Support**: If you have any technical difficulties, please reach out to the interview coordinator.
